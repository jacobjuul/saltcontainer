MYTH
Theme Version: 1.0.7
Author: Michael Van Den Berg 
Author URL: https://michaelvandenberg.com/

--------------------
=== Description ===
--------------------

The return of the good, old fashioned, three column holy grail layout. In times past bloggers honored their content with fashionable sidebars on the left AND right side of the screen. Myth plans to uphold that sacred tradition. Yet, it's modern, responsive and accessibility-ready, and it supports several post formats (Quote, Aside, Links).
